        <h3><img src="image for lab5/tface.png" >Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents, and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly revealing himself as Iron Man.</h3>
        <p>first iron_man</p><h3> <img src="image for lab5/iron1.jpg" alt ="first iron1"> The 2012 "Mandarin" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, almost losing Pepper Potts in the process. In the wake of the battle, Stark destroyed all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of Wolfgang von Strucker and acquiring Loki's Scepter.
            Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Wanda Maximoff's mind games, built Ultron with the help of Bruce Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost.</h3>

        <h3><img src="image for lab5/thorface1.jpg" alt="thor1" >Thor (In Old Norse Þórr) is the almighty God of thunder in Norse mythology, he is the son of Odin and Giantess Fjörgyn. Thor is associated with the day Thursday which comes from the word Torsdag in the Scandinavian countries and in the Germanic countries it is called Donnerstag which means thunder day and comes from the word Donar, which was the name of Thor in the Germanic countries.

            The Giants really love to make fun of him and because Thor is very ill-tempered it immediately makes him furious, it often results in Thor grabbing his hammer Mjölnir it hit them over the head, When Thor is enraged, it makes loud noises with sparks and lightning. This makes the giants crumble in fear and sends chills down their spines. Thor loves to fight the giants, and with his hammer Mjölnir, he always has the upper hand..</h3>
